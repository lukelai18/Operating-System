 * and `namelen` the basename of path.
 *
 * Return 0 on success, or:
 *  - EINVAL: path refers to an empty string
 *  - Propagate errors from namev_lookup()
 *
 * Hints:
 *  - When *calling* namev_dir(), if it is unclear what to pass as the `base`, you
 *    should use `curproc->p_cwd` (think about why this makes sense).
 *  - `curproc` is a global variable that represents the current running process 
 *    (a proc_t struct), which has a field called p_cwd. 
 *  - The first parameter, base, is the vnode from which to start resolving
 *    path, unless path starts with a '/', in which case you should start at
 *    the root vnode, vfs_root_fs.fs_root.
 *  - Use namev_lookup() to handle each individual lookup. When looping, be
 *    careful about locking and refcounts, and make sure to clean up properly
 *    upon failure.
 *  - namev_lookup() should return with the found vnode unlocked, unless the
 *    found vnode is the same as the given directory (e.g. "/./."). Be mindful
 *    of this special case, and any locking/refcounting that comes with it.
 *  - When parsing the path, you do not need to implement hand-over-hand
 *    locking. That is, when calling `namev_lookup(dir, path, pathlen, &out)`,
 *    it is safe to put away and unlock dir before locking `out`.
 *  - You are encouraged to use namev_tokenize() to help parse path.  
 *  - Whether you're using the provided base or the root vnode, you will have
 *    to explicitly lock and reference your starting vnode before using it.
 *  - Don't allocate memory to return name. Just set name to point into the
 *    correct part of path.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *  - "/a/.././//b/ccc/" ==> res_vnode = vnode for b, name = "ccc", namelen = 3
 *  - "tmp/..//." ==> res_vnode = base, name = ".", namelen = 1
 *  - "/dev/null" ==> rev_vnode = vnode for /dev, name = "null", namelen = 4
 * For more examples of expected behavior, you can try out the command line
 * utilities `dirname` and `basename` on your virtual machine or a Brown
 * department machine.
